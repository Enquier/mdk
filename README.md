Cameo MDK is a plugin for [Cameo Systems Modeler](https://www.nomagic.com/products/cameo-systems-modeler) and other No Magic environment bundles thatâ€™s primary purposes are to sync models with the [MMS](https://github.com/Open-MBEE/mms-alfresco) and implement the [DocGen](src/main/dist/manual) language, which allows modelers to dynamically generate documents in a model-based approach using the view and viewpoint concept.

    * The latest Cameo MDK is tested with and supports **19.0 SP3**. Compatibility for previous versions of Cameo MDK can be found in the [compatibility matrices](https://github.com/Open-MBEE/open-mbee.github.io/wiki/Compatibilities).
* [Model Management System (MMS) 3](https://github.com/Open-MBEE/mms-alfresco)
